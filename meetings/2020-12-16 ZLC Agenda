Mike D out (started his vacation) 

1) Joe - any "fires" - do we know the status of 1.18 release? Docker content ready? Note comment below from Zebra team regarding "tricky"
T&C's. 

2) SHARE - I am told 8 Zowe sessions submitted for Open Source track will be declined. I plan to contact submitters and see if they
would like to participate in a OMP event. I need to discuss with Mae/Chris/John on the logistics.  

3) Rose - To the ZLC are there survey questions we want to ask? Please use this link: https://ibm.box.com/s/2asdvj0ca6mqkhozumha43dpy7vfn2m5 to the BOX folder.  

4) Future of ZLC https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/220  Bruce still to document proposal in issue (holiday to-do) 

5) Zebra update - prepare moving Zebra code/docs to Zowe repository. Security scan was good – 
just need to add EPL 2.0 /DCO and clarify some more about docker use case since it’s license T&Cs can be tricky 
so we want to make sure it’s not part of Zebra but just an example.

6) Reminder - no ZLC meeting next 2 weeks - I tried to cancel but my calendar does not process the cancel notice. We will start again 
Jan 6th. 

7) I am considering a end of year blog on 2020 accomplishements - anyone around next couple days to help? I am thinking we post to 
Medium and point to via Linkedin. 

Any other topics? 

Everyone have safe and Happy Holidays
