Note - I am still working on the use of github desktop for meeting agendas and recordings. Last two agendas showing in 
https://github.com/zowe/zlc/blob/armstro-patch-4/meetings 

1) Status of 1.14? - 
    a) Content deferred to meet release date (per ZLC request) - outlook for completing planned content - 
    is there something ZLC can assist? 

    b) Email request from Ashley for Release Notes review - Peter confirm you have seen since you asked for 
    improved process on content. 

2) No traction on ZLC working session (1 repsonse) - request to have mini-working session on Support Conformance Criteria with 
ZLC (Mike, Peter, Bruce) for playback to ZLC for future session - https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/182 

3) Share sessions delayed to Aug 26 - does not seem to be official on the share.org website 
https://event.share.org/page/share-virtual-2020-faq - will ask for help to adverstise new day and times - I sent email to 
Share this morning to ask when new day 

4) Review https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues
