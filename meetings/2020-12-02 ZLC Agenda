Joe - any hot topics - and I think this will be the last time I need to ask and TSC will take over going forward {8-) }

1) Zebra proposal - Overview presentation, and demo - request a vote on making incubator - propose as subproject of the Systems Team (but
open to other ideas)

2) TSC status - Understanding is voting will close this Friday and assuming passage - next step will be for TSC to meet and decide their
own leadership and meeting process. (I propose a campaign to attract other qualified technical leaders to the TSC to increase diversity.)

3) Rose created a folder to house each Squad's set of SURVEY questions for our upcoming (Jan 2021) Zowe survey.  
Please use this link: https://ibm.box.com/s/2asdvj0ca6mqkhozumha43dpy7vfn2m5 to the BOX folder.  
Once you arrive at the folder, locate your Squad's document, follow the instructions at the top.  
Deadline for questions is 12/15.

4) SHARE sessions - pleasantly surprised with number and quality of submissions - there is rumor of a "Zowe Day" but not ititated by me. 
We will need to see which sessions are accepted and how they are scheduled.
