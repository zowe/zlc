1) Any fires needing brought to the ZLC attention? 

2) There was an IBM sponsored event yesterday that included a Z Open track - anyone attend to give 
brief summary/review?

3) Mae sent press release for today to some of us working the "booth" for OMP Summit - here is headline. Not to be
released until 9am Pacific 

Open Mainframe Project Announces Record Growth with the Launch of Four New
Projects, a COBOL Working Group and Micro Focus as a New Member
CBT Tape, GenevaERS, Software Discovery Tool and Mainframe Open Education solidifies
Open Mainframe Project as a cornerstone for training, enterprise, devops and z/OS

FYI - I am in touch with https://genevaers.org/ chair - z/OS based tool but we have not drilled into any 
possible Zowe integration yet. 

4) TSC - https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/183 - I created a 2nd draft of charter, Peter reviewed and 
update for clarity (Thanks Peter)
    - Anyone else get a chance to review ? (Understand Sean is tied up Mon-Wed)
    - One area of concern was how "Additional Technical Leaders" would be selected for the TSC after
    the initial appointment of three from ZLC? 
        - How long is that appointment - I said 1 year
        - I assume they could be voted to stay (no term limits) 
        - What if others (other than squad leads) are deserving to be on the TSC - I propose 
        anyone could be nominated, 2nded and voted on by unamious agreement 
    - Also see John's comment on voting: change of governance, it would be good to have a consensus 
    of Zowe Committers. That vote should also include the initial TSC members.
    - We need to update the list of committers for voting purposes 

5) Project Managers and Squad Leads are looking for feedback from ZLC on 4Q PI Planning - has everyone 
listened to their plans - any comments we want to offer? Next meeting is tomorrow 10am eastern - can 
someone cover? 
- We can preview TSC if we agree on draft charter and ask for feedback?
