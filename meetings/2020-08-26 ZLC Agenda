1) Lock in dates for next PI planning Oct 1-2 - 
    a) Ask the project managers to organize call with squad leads on: 
        - Status of the 3Q plans 
        - New backlog items they feel are high priority 
    b) Does ZLC have any updated views on prior themes? 
        - Research on globalization? Sizing of effort
        - Increased focus on automated testing - include in code check in process? 
    c) Do we want to try another survey? or defer to OMP Zowe event? (See next item) 
        - If we want survey - who to own? 
        - Survey Monkey via OMP should work - need to obtain edit authority from John M - worked well 
        last time using LastPass service 

2) Need to close on https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/210 - for 3Q OMP event - some different views on
