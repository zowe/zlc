3) Can we close of the TSC proposal - ZLC issue here https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/183
Joe's draft as pull request https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/charter.md
John's revisions https://github.com/zowe/community/pull/795

4) Topic from Mark - I have a topic for our next ZLC meeting - collaboration tools. 
Some of our squad members are looking for direction on better interactive collab tooling - i.e. using Boxnote 
or Google Drive.  We discussed this in the past and don't want to revisit every detail, but Github / Wikis 
fail on interactive collaboration and certainly multimedia collaboration (videos, ppts). 
Other open source communities use Google Drive (mostly), but I think we were trying to be 
accommodating to Chinese developers by not using it. Did that evolve at all?

5) Next week's meeting? - and maybe discuss holiday schedule
Week of Thanksgiving in US: Nov 25th 
December: 23rd and 30th 

6) Univerity of Nebraska grad students - conversation still going on - working on the threat modeling portion 
of this project. Given the cadence of this project timeline so far I would estimate that it would be due 
between November 13th and November 20th.
