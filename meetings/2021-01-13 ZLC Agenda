1) Rose - We ok with survey? Survey Monkey access? 
    - I added a Zebra question to the ZLC section (and slacked to you) if you can squeeze in one more question
    - Team the merged questions here: https://ibm.box.com/s/a894qmlc0u2cn0app1ey51zthsrqjmyj .  
    - I recall Survey Monkey allowing dry run of questions - do you want to preview to the TSC/ZLC? 
    - If we are ready before the 20th webinar do we want to post early to have feedback for PI Planning 
        and advertise on LinkedIn? or other social medium? 
    - Any update on webinar pre-registriatons? 
    - See email - do we already have 2Q webinar topic lined up? Understanding token based security in Zowe from 
    Michal Supak, Pavlin Zahariev

    1) Jakub notice ZLC and TSC have 50 mins to share - I think we should try to close on ZLC/TSC charters 
        Draft of TSC charter https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UN72RujWpmIVwtGuv0PyrRs-qygVQsyILuLyKFmE4Ho/edit#slide=id.gaacdd627dd_0_11 
    2) To ZLC members - I'd like help with a few slides for PI Planning kickoff covering 2020, 2021 outlook and any commentary on 
    proposed 1QPI priorities  

3) Hate to repeat myself but future of ZLC https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/220  Mike D with Peter out the week of 18th 
can you and I sync up on ideas. 

4) I've expanded the zCX access issue in github to be "infrastructure" planning (OpenShift, Sysplex, zCX, etc.) 
    Other ZLC issues: Support Conformance Criteria - I've had two customers ask how support will be done across distribtuions from 
    different companies 

5) Many thanks to Rose for moving the blog along - Peter, Joe any thoughts on what else you would like to see covered?
