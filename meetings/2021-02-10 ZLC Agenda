No meetings the last two weeks due to PI Planning and other conflicts last week preventing a quorum to attend.  

1) Zowe survey - as of yesterday we had 30 replies - ideas on how to drive more replies? We set 
deadline of this Friday. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PSGBKRN 
    I have socialized on LinkedIn, to GTS, and ISVs in TDM plus selected others 
    
2) ZLC charter - no changes since the PI Planning preview - technically existing ZLC needs vote Feb 26 per current charter - 
https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/220 PI Planning deck from ZLC here:  
https://github.com/zowe/community/commit/7fa63bd59a0911b5e77c3cf6e56c924572ca708e I'd like to finalize the words and get existing ZLC to vote by end of next week - need to decide how/if community vote to be done by
Feb 26. 

3) Any update from the TSC? 
    - Sprint dates decided 
    - Research on Caching infrastructure 

4) 2Q webinar topic lined up? Understanding token based security in Zowe? from Michal Supak, Pavlin Zahariev - question out to them. 

5) IBM has 5-7 new deverlopers joining various squads. These are members of an team we refer to as Jump Start - they earn credit/badge
for open source contributions. They are not full time on Zowe - this is in addition to their day job. 

One "process issue" we should decide is whether Zoew/OMP want to put in place a ICLA from the developers as their signed assertion 
of the originality of their commits as being their own and save scanned images of those documents in the zlc or another OMP archive. 
We use that as the legal basis for their signoff and we turn off DCO.  The gate is no one is allowed access without a signed 
ICLA (Individual Contributor License Agreement). It would make the process less tedious and achieve the legal requirements we 
are looking for.  

6) I still need to finish blog https://ibm.box.com/s/ar7s6m7b520pw2fgfmmz813f7tc7bo3n my bad 

7) If there is time https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues and move some to TSC issues 

8) Zebra team getting some traction - member of Watson Walker consulting practice offering to help with performance measurement on zPDT,
lessons learned to be applied to Zowe startup.
