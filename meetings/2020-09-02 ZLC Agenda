Any fires needing fought? 

1) System demo yesterday went well - status and outlook for 1.15? Do we want to more widely publizce 
the System Demos to drive more attenance? i.e., post the recording to LinkedIn? 
https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Project%20Management/System%20Demo/System_Demo_Recordings.md 

2) PI planning prep for Oct 1-2  https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/214 
    a) Status of call with squad leads on? 
    b) Question on doing a survey https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/215 
    c) Need to create/update the ZLC point of view (metrics) and themes?  Volunteers? 
    d) Can we be ready to present TCS by then? See later topic on draft mission of TSC 
    e) Question to squads if they see a need for reVersion next year? 

2) OMP Summit https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-mainframe-summit/ - what can we do to help 
drive attenance? Status of booth participation?  
https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-mainframe-summit/program/schedule/
    
3) OMP 3Q event plan https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/210  see agenda in issue 

4) Review/discuss TSC charter draft  https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/183 

5) Did anyone get back to Mae? 

Request from Mae: Iâ€™m preparing a news package for Open Mainframe Summit 
(hopefully, you all are already registered!) and wanted to check in to see if 
Zowe had any new updates or milestones that we should include in the press release. 
 
Please let me know if you have anything by EOD Friday, August 21. 

Do we use the Summit to kick off the Zowe Webinar series? 

6) Mini-ZLC working session on Support Conformance Criteria will need to be rescheduled 


And any other topics folks want to bring up......
