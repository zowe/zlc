Joe - any fires? 

1) TSC - members are identified and committer list has had time to be updated - I recommend we ask John to begin voting 
    - Voting for Rose for On Boarding due Friday but I think she is running unopposed 
    - https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/TSCMEMBERS.csv
    - https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/COMMITTERS.csv
            
            Suggested email text from John - The Zowe Leadership Committee in cooperation with the squads recommended the formation 
            of a Zowe Technical Steering Committee (TSC). We are asking the community vote on TSC and it's mission. The TSC is a 
            natural next step in goverance of Zowe as the project matures. 

2) Discussion on 4Q PI content trade-offs
