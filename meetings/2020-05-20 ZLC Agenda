1) Firm up content for OMP webinar next week - one topic is whether it is premature to say zCX is the container strategy since 
we still need research (zLinux could be equal option or off-box) 

2) Zowe Community Github (update from Sujay) 
    
3) Discuss https://github.com/phaumer/zowe-explorer-ftp-extensionÂ if needed - mentioned for ZLC but I think this is mainly the Explorer
squad to decide - question is does this become part of Zowe "core" and questions on packaging? 

4) PI Planning planning - https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/187
    - Ok to do intros of names proposed for improving squad diversity? 
    - We (ZLC) owe point of view on priorities for next PI - how to agree?  - how specific to be?
    - Words from OMP webinar deck: Security, Resilience, Community/Ecosystem, Serviceability
    - Other areas mentioned: "App Convergence" and "Expanded Testing (CI/CD)" 

5) Most other topics in issues: https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues 

Other topics anyone wants to bring up.....
